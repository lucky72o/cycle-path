# CycleMonitor - Natural Fertility Tracking

A privacy-focused, open-source fertility tracking application built with [Wasp](https://wasp.sh), based on the [Open Saas](https://opensaas.sh) template.

## Overview

CycleMonitor is a comprehensive fertility awareness application designed to help users track their menstrual cycles using evidence-based Fertility Awareness Methods (FAM). The app provides tools for monitoring multiple fertility indicators including basal body temperature (BBT), cervical fluid, menstrual flow, and ovulation predictor kit results.

### Key Features

- **Privacy-First**: Your fertility data stays with you. Self-hostable and transparent.
- **Data Control**: Import cycle data from CSV files and maintain full database access.
- **Evidence-Based**: Built on established fertility awareness methods and cycle tracking principles.
- **Multi-Indicator Tracking**: Comprehensive fertility sign monitoring for accurate cycle insights.

## Core Features

### 🔄 Cycle Management
- Create and manage multiple menstrual cycles
- Track cycle start and end dates
- View current and historical cycles with cycle day count displayed in the title (e.g. "Cycle #1: 28 days"); active cycles show the number of recorded entries, past cycles show the total cycle span
- Delete cycles with cascade deletion of all associated data
- Chronological cycle navigation on the days page: **Previous Cycle** always links to the cycle that started before the current one, **Next Cycle** to the one that started after

### 📝 Daily Data Entry
Track multiple fertility indicators for each day:

- **Basal Body Temperature (BBT)**
  - Record temperature with time tracking
  - Support for both Fahrenheit and Celsius
  - Automatic unit conversion and storage
  - Flag outlier temperatures to exclude from interpretation

- **Cervical Fluid Tracking**
  - **Appearance**: None, Sticky, Creamy, Watery, Eggwhite
  - **Sensation**: Dry, Damp, Wet, Slippery
  - Built-in educational tooltips for each category

- **Menstrual Flow**
  - Track flow levels: Spotting, Light, Medium, Heavy, Very Heavy
  - Educational guidance on distinguishing spotting from menstruation
  - Visual indicators on chart: watercolor blood drops for spotting, graduated bars for flow levels

- **Ovulation Predictor Kit (OPK)**
  - Track LH hormone levels: Low, Rising, Peak, Declining
  - Detailed descriptions for interpreting test results

- **Disturbance Factor Tracking**
  - Multi-select section for logging factors that may affect BBT reliability
  - Eight factors, each with a dedicated emoji and explanatory tooltip:
    - 🌙 Poor Sleep · ✈️ Travel · 😵 Stress · 🤒 Illness/Fever · ⏰ Different Wake Time · 🍷 Alcohol the Evening Before · 💊 Medication · 🌡️ Hot/Cold Room
  - Displayed in a two-column responsive grid (single column on mobile)
  - Each factor has an info (ℹ) icon; hovering reveals a detailed explanation
  - The section title itself has a hover tooltip: "Something that may cause your basal body temperature rise or drop, making the reading less reliable"
  - Selecting ✈️ **Travel** reveals an optional time-difference stepper (–12 to +12 hours) to record timezone or schedule changes
  - All selected factors and the travel time difference are persisted with the day entry and pre-populated when editing

- **Additional Tracking**
  - Intercourse tracking
  - Custom notes and observations

### 📊 Data Visualization
- Interactive cycle charts displaying temperature patterns
- Color-coded fertility indicators
- Visual representation of cervical fluid and menstrual flow
- **Menstrual Flow Symbols**:
  - **Spotting**: Custom blood drop SVG icon (three drops with shine highlights)
  - **Light/Medium/Heavy/Very Heavy**: Graduated bar heights with color intensity
- LH test status row on chart with symbols (low, rising, peak, declining)
- Flower markers on Peak LH days in the temperature graph
- Green gradient fertile window highlighting for Rising/Peak LH days
- "Fertile Window" label centered on the fertile period
- Day-by-day detailed view
- **Interactive Crosshair & Tooltip System**:
  - **Vertical Crosshair**: A dashed line spans the entire chart height when hovering/tapping anywhere in the graph plot area over a column with recorded data
  - **Graph-Only Activation**: The crosshair and tooltip are triggered exclusively by hovering (or tapping on mobile) within the temperature graph section. The table rows below the graph respond visually (column highlight) but do not independently trigger the tooltip
  - **Smart Hover Detection**: Only columns with recorded data (BBT, time, OPK, intimacy, cervical fluid, menstrual flow, or disturbance factors) are interactive; columns without any data remain non-interactive
  - **No-Temperature Days**: Days that have recorded data but no temperature reading still activate the crosshair and tooltip when hovering over the corresponding vertical column in the graph area. The tooltip shows the date, cycle day number, and any disturbance factor symbols
  - **Unified Tooltip**: A single, context-aware tooltip displays comprehensive day information including date, weekday, cycle day number, temperature (if recorded), time stamp, intercourse status, exclusion flags, and disturbance factors as emoji symbols
  - **Disturbance Factor Symbols in Tooltip**: If disturbance factors were recorded, they appear as individual emoji symbols. For the Travel factor, the time difference is always shown before the emoji (e.g. `+3h ✈️` or `-1h ✈️`). A negative time change flips the plane emoji horizontally via CSS `scaleX(-1)` to indicate westward/behind-schedule travel. Full symbol legend: 🌙 Poor sleep · ✈️ Travel · 😵 Stress · 🤒 Illness/Fever · ⏰ Different wake time · 🍷 Alcohol · 💊 Medication · 🌡️ Hot/Cold room
  - **Mobile Touch Support**: Touch events (`touchstart`, `touchmove`, `touchend`) mirror desktop hover behavior. Touching a column in the graph activates the crosshair and tooltip; moving to a new column updates the tooltip to that column. Lifting the finger dismisses the tooltip after a short delay. Horizontal scroll gestures (>10 px movement) are distinguished from taps and dismiss the tooltip immediately
  - **Tooltip Overflow Guard**: On narrow screens the tooltip automatically flips to the left of the crosshair when there is insufficient space on the right
  - **Technical Implementation**: Custom React overlay with native DOM event listeners on the ApexCharts canvas for reliable detection, independent of the charting library's tooltip system
  - **Edit from Chart**: The tooltip card is always interactive and shows a compact **Edit** button at the bottom that navigates directly to the day entry form (`/cycles/:cycleId/add-day?dayId=...`). On desktop the button shows the text "Edit" (ghost style); on mobile it shows a pencil icon (outline style). The Edit button is reachable by moving the cursor from any temperature node into the tooltip — no click required. This is implemented via several complementary mechanisms:
    - **Hover bridge**: the tooltip card catches `onMouseEnter` and cancels a 600 ms delayed close, keeping the tooltip open while the cursor travels from the trigger to the card.
    - **Hover shield**: the outer tooltip wrapper is extended 56 px toward the cursor (left in the normal case, right when flipped). This invisible `pointer-events-auto` zone prevents the tooltip from dismissing while the cursor is in transit to the Edit button.
    - **Stable cell-centre positioning**: the tooltip X position is anchored to the hovered day's column centre (`crosshairX`) rather than the live cursor position. This makes the tooltip appear at a deterministic, predictable location for each day regardless of where within the column the cursor enters.
    - **Improved overflow flip**: when the tooltip would overflow the right edge of the container it flips to the left, and is positioned so its right edge sits only 4 px to the left of the cell centre, minimising the travel distance to the Edit button.
    - On desktop, clicking a graph column **pins** the tooltip (making it persistent) so the Edit button can be clicked; the pin clears when clicking the same column again or clicking outside the plot area.
  - **Date and Weekday Formatting in Tooltip**: The tooltip displays dates in **DD MMM YYYY** format (e.g. "24 Oct 2025") and weekdays as full names (e.g. "Monday") rather than abbreviations
- **Disturbance Row in Chart Table**: A dedicated "Disturbance" row appears below the "Dry" cervical fluid row in the lower chart table, styled with a light violet (`#f3e8ff`) background using the same rounded-square cell pattern as the cervical fluid rows (0.5 px white gap on all sides, `borderRadius: 2px`). Each cell shows the disturbance recorded for that day:
  - Single disturbance: the corresponding emoji (🌙 😵 🤒 ⏰ 🍷 💊 🌡️)
  - Travel with a positive time difference: ✈️ (normal orientation)
  - Travel with a negative time difference: ✈️ horizontally flipped via CSS `scaleX(-1)` to indicate westward/behind-schedule travel
  - Two or more disturbances on the same day: a count followed by a warning symbol (e.g. `3⚠️`)

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v18 or higher recommended)
- **PostgreSQL** (v12 or higher)
- **Wasp CLI** - Install via: `curl -sSL https://get.wasp-lang.dev/installer.sh | sh`

### Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd cycle-path/app
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables**
   
   Create `.env.server` in the app root:
   ```env
   DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/cyclemonitor"
   # Add SMTP credentials for email functionality
   SMTP_HOST="your-smtp-host"
   SMTP_PORT="587"
   SMTP_USERNAME="your-username"
   SMTP_PASSWORD="your-password"
   ```
   
   Create `.env.client` in the app root (if needed):
   ```env
   # Client-side environment variables
   ```

3. **Start the database**
   ```bash
   wasp start db
   ```
   
   Leave this running in a separate terminal. This starts a PostgreSQL instance in Docker.

4. **Run database migrations**
   ```bash
   wasp db migrate-dev
   ```
   
   This applies all schema migrations from the `migrations/` directory.

5. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   wasp start
   ```
   
   This starts both the client (React) and server (Node.js) in development mode.
   - Client: `http://localhost:3000`
   - Server: `http://localhost:3001`

6. **[Optional] Seed test data**
   ```bash
   wasp db seed
   ```
   
   This populates the database with mock users for development.

### First-Time Setup Notes

- After starting the app, you'll need to create an account via the signup page
- Email verification links will be printed to the server console (when using Dummy email provider in development)
- Check the server logs for any email-related output during signup/password reset

```

### Operations Pattern

Wasp uses a declarative operations pattern for client-server communication:

1. **Define in `main.wasp`**:
   ```wasp
   query getUserCycles {
     fn: import { getUserCycles } from "@src/cycle-tracking/operations",
     entities: [Cycle, CycleDay]
   }
   ```

2. **Implement in `operations.ts`**:
   ```typescript
   export const getUserCycles: GetUserCycles = async (args, context) => {
     if (!context.user) throw new HttpError(401);
     return context.entities.Cycle.findMany({
       where: { userId: context.user.id },
       include: { days: true }
     });
   };
   ```

3. **Use in React components**:
   ```typescript
   import { useQuery } from 'wasp/client/operations';
   import { getUserCycles } from 'wasp/client/operations';
   
   const { data: cycles, isLoading } = useQuery(getUserCycles);
   ```

### Type Safety

Wasp generates TypeScript types automatically:
- **Entities**: Import from `wasp/entities` (e.g., `import type { Cycle, CycleDay } from 'wasp/entities'`)
- **Operations**: Import from `wasp/server/operations` (e.g., `import type { GetUserCycles } from 'wasp/server/operations'`)
- **Client Operations**: Import from `wasp/client/operations` (auto-typed hooks and functions)

### Key Files Reference

- **[`main.wasp`](main.wasp)** - App configuration, routes, operations, auth setup
- **[`schema.prisma`](schema.prisma)** - Database models: User, Cycle, CycleDay, UserSettings
- **[`src/cycle-tracking/operations.ts`](src/cycle-tracking/operations.ts)** - Server-side cycle operations
- **[`src/cycle-tracking/CycleChartPage.tsx`](src/cycle-tracking/CycleChartPage.tsx)** - Main chart visualization with:
  - LH test status row display
  - Peak LH flower markers with stacking-aware overlays
  - Fertile window gradient visualization
  - Inline SVG blood drop icon for spotting indicator
  - Disturbance row below "Dry": light violet CF-style cells; ✈️ normal for positive travel time diff, ✈️ flipped (`scaleX(-1)`) for negative; `N⚠️` for multiple factors
  - Tooltip travel display: `+Xh ✈️` / `-Xh ✈️flipped` with hour offset always shown when a time diff is recorded
  - Touch event support for crosshair/tooltip on mobile (touchstart/touchmove on canvas and all table cells; dismiss on tap outside)
  - Tooltip hover shield: invisible `pointer-events-auto` extension on the cursor-approach side blocks adjacent cells from re-triggering during transit
  - Tooltip anchored to cell-centre crosshair for stable, per-day positioning (no live-cursor chase)
  - 600 ms delayed close with `cancelClose`/`scheduleClose` helpers and `tooltipHoveredRef` hover bridge
  - Pinned tooltip state (`pinnedDayNumber`/`pinnedCrosshairX`) for persistent touch interaction
- **[`src/cycle-tracking/AddCycleDayPage.tsx`](src/cycle-tracking/AddCycleDayPage.tsx)** - Daily entry form with all fertility indicators
- **[`src/cycle-tracking/utils.ts`](src/cycle-tracking/utils.ts)** - Temperature conversion, date utilities, and cycle helpers (`fahrenheitToCelsius`, `formatDate`, `formatDateLong`, `formatDateDDMMMYYYY`, `getDayOfWeek`, `getDayOfWeekAbbreviation`, `getCycleDayCount`)

```

## Contributing

### Development Workflow

1. **Adding a new feature**:
   - Define data models in [`schema.prisma`](schema.prisma)
   - Run `wasp db migrate-dev "Description"` to create migration
   - Define operations (queries/actions) in [`main.wasp`](main.wasp)
   - Implement operations in `src/[feature]/operations.ts`
   - Create UI components and pages
   - Add routes in [`main.wasp`](main.wasp)

2. **Code Style**:
   - Use TypeScript for all code
   - Follow existing patterns in the codebase
   - Use Wasp's generated types (`wasp/entities`, `wasp/server/operations`)
   - Import Wasp modules with `wasp/...` prefix (not `@wasp/...`)
   - Use ShadCN UI components for consistency

3. **Wasp Patterns**:
   - Define operations in [`main.wasp`](main.wasp) with proper entity dependencies
   - Keep operation implementations in feature-specific `operations.ts` files
   - Use `useQuery` for data fetching, direct `await` for actions (not `useAction`)
   - Handle errors with `HttpError` from `wasp/server`

4. **Database Changes**:
   - Always create migrations: `wasp db migrate-dev "Description"`
   - Test migrations on clean database before committing
   - Update operation entity dependencies in [`main.wasp`](main.wasp) when adding/modifying entities
